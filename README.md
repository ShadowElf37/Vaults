# Vaults v2
Simple Python script for making and managing encrypted vaults. Vaults use symmetrically encrypted RSA keys to encode and decode data.

Requires pycryptodome (and opencv-python if you want image display).

Updates from v1:
- Supports storing whole files of unlimited size
- Supports image display
- Changes to backend

See `test()` function at the bottom of vault.py for example usage.
